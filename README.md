# ue-pond

This is a small scene I made in Unreal Engine to refresh my skills of basic landscaping and visal/camera affects. It has a pond, surrounded by trees, fences, and a hill in the background. Unreal Engine only allowed me to export the FBX for this model, which I attached, and I also converted that FBX to an STL file via an online converter. I couldn't attach the entire Unreal Engine project as it was over 15 gigabytes.
